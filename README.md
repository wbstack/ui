For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

## Development

### Running against mocked api

This ui uses Mock Service Worker (https://mswjs.io/) to mock the backend api for test purposes.

To run dev server with mocked api, set env variable `API_MOCK` to a value that evaluates to `true`:

```
API_MOCK=1 npm run dev
```

Currently, logging in using any email and password will behave as if the same user is always logging in.
Created wikis by that user will live in local storage (`msw-myWikis` key)

Backend api mocks live in `/src/backend/mocks/default_handlers.js`.

**Note**
Firefox blocks service workers as long as we use `localhost` for local development. The only solution is to use
chrom(ium) for now.

----

**Possible issues**
Node Sass could not find a binding for your current environment: Linux 64-bit with Node.js 8.x

wbstack-ui requires node-sass.

If your OS does not match the OS of the Docker container then you will not have the node-sass bindings to match the Docker OS.

In order to get these bindings run "npm rebuild node-sass" in the ui container. Which in the docker-compose land you can do "docker-compose exec ui-dev bash" and then run it.
