    <h2>Make your structured data available in our cloud</h2>
    <p>If you've wanted to run your own Wikibase but don't have the infrastructure and support you'd need, Wikibase.cloud is for you. You provide the data – we provide a full-fledged and fully managed Wikibase. </p>
    <h3>Coming soon</h3>
    <p>Wikibase.cloud is in a closed beta, which means we're not yet accepting account requests. If you're interested in a Wikibase.cloud instance, sign up for early access to our closed beta <a href="https://lime.wikimedia.de/index.php/717538">here</a>. While you wait, consider joining the Wikibase community <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/wikibase-cloud.lists.wikimedia.org/">mailing list</a>.</p>
