    <h2>Make your structured data available in our cloud</h2>
    <p>If you've wanted to run your own Wikibase but don't have the infrastructure and support you'd need, Wikibase.cloud is for you. You provide the data â€“ we provide a full-fledged and fully managed Wikibase. </p>
    <h3>Coming soon</h3>
    <p>Wikibase.cloud is in a closed beta, which means we're not yet accepting account requests. While you wait, consider joining the Wikibase community mailing list.</p>
