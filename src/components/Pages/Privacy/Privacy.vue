                Please be aware: Wikibase.cloud is a platform that enables
                everyone to create and run their own open knowledge base as an

                Instances and the processing of personal data when you visit and

                  <h4>General use of the platform</h4>
                  <p>
                    We automatically record the accesses to our websites.
                    Therefore, when you visit our website, you transmit certain
                    technical data to us, namely:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>IP address,</li>
                    <li>accessed content,</li>
                    <li>information about the transmission,</li>
                    <li>date of access,</li>
                    <li>the amount of data transmitted,</li>
                    <li>the referrer,</li>
                    <li>the web browser/user agent.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    Where the GDPR applies, the processing of the IP address
                    when establishing a connection is based on Art. 6 par. 1
                    lit. b) GDPR to provide the website you requested.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our host also creates so-called log files to maintain system
                    security, in order to guarantee the security and integrity
                    of our IT systems in which the information above (excluding
                    the amount of data transmitted) is stored. These purposes
                    also represent the legitimate interest for which the
                    processing is carried out (Art. 6 par. 1 lit. f) GDPR). We
                    store the logs for a period of 30 days and delete them
                    afterwards.

                  <h4>Registering for a user account</h4>
                  <p>
                    To create wikis you have to sign up and create a user
                    account. For this purpose we collect and process your email
                    address and a password. We will send you a validation email
                    to the address you have provided. The legal basis for the
                    processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR. We process your
                    personal data for as long as you have your account with us
                    and delete it thereafter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you register with us, we need to ensure that you have no
                    malicious intentions. Hence, it is necessary that we check
                    your IP Address against a few internationally recognized
                    spam and abuse prevention services, namely
                    combined.abuse.ch, xbl.spamhaus.org, cbl.abuseat.org,
                    http.dnsbl.sorbs.net, opm.tornevall.org, all.s5h.net,
                    dnsbl.dronebl.org. The processing is based as well on Art. 6
                    par. 1 lit. b) GDPR since without this verification we
                    cannot enter into a contractual relationship with you. Some
                    of the services mentioned above reside in countries outside
                    of the EU. Spamhaus and combined.abuse reside in Andorra and
                    Switzerland. The European Commission has adopted an adaquacy
                    decision for both countries. Dnsbl.sorbs.net and
                    dnsbl.dronebl.org may process personal data in countries
                    without such a decision. In this case (ans also any other
                    case where one of the service providers may process personal
                    data in a third country without an adaquacy decision) the
                    transfer is based on Art. 49 par. 1 lit. d) GDPR.

                  <h4>Creating a wikibase or mediawiki</h4>

                  <p>
                    On our Website you can easily set up a Wikibase or mediawiki
                    instance where you can create collaborative knowledge bases
                    and publish data. You have to choose a site name, a site
                    domain and an initial admin username. This information as
                    well as any data published on your wikibase or mediawiki
                    will be publicly available once your wiki is published. The
                    legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b)
                    GDPR. We process your personal data for as long as you have
                    your account with us and delete it thereafter.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h4>Contact</h4>
                  <p>
                    You can contact us via email. We will then process your
                    email address and, if applicable, your name, a subject and
                    the content of your request to answer your enquiry due to
                    our legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We will store your enquiry until we have answered it and
                    fulfilled your request. We will delete it afterwards unless
                    legal provisions prevent deletion. We may store data in
                    accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR where it is
                    necessary for providing evidence or to comply with legal
                    retention periods in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c)
                    GDPR. If the request is made within the framework of an
                    existing or prospective contractual relationship with us,
                    the storage period shall be based on the underlying
                    contractual relationship.

              <h4>Categories of recipients</h4>
              <p>
                We use external service providers if we are unable to provide
                services ourselves or if it is not reasonable to do so. These
                external service providers are primarily providers of IT
                services, such as our hosting service provider Google Ireland
                Ltd., Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4.
              </p>
              <p>
                To ensure the encryption of your wikibase or mediawiki, and
                provide the Website with an HTTPS/SSL certificate we will
                transfer the domain name to the Let's encrypt certification
                agency, 548 Market St, PMB 57274, San Francisco, CA 94104-5401,
                which is necessary to create the certificate.
              </p>
              <p>
                For sending emails, we use the service mailgun of the Mailgun
                Technologies, Inc., 112 E Pecan St. #1135, San Antonio, TX
                78205. We have concluded Standard Contractual Clauses with
                mailgun as appropriate safeguards to ensure an adequate level of
                protection of your personal data.

              <h4>Google reCaptcha</h4>
              <p>
                We use the Google reCaptcha service provided by Google Ireland
                Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland
                ("Google"). Google reCaptcha uses the following data to check
                whether you are a human or a computer: IP address of the end
                device used, the website that you visit with us and on which the
                captcha is embedded, the date and duration of the visit, the
                recognition data of the browser and operating system type used,
                mouse movements and possibly other technical data. In addition,
                Google sets cookies on your device. We do not gain any knowledge
                of the data collected and processed by Google. The legal basis
                for the data processing described above is Art. 6 para. 1 lit.
                f) DS-GVO. We have a legitimate interest in ensuring the
                security of our website and protecting ourselves against
                automated entries (attacks). For this reason, we cannot offer
                you the option to object here, but must point out that you
                should not use the function protected by the reCaptcha function
                in this case and should not call up the associated page.
